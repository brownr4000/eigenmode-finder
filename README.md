# Eigenmode Finder
A FORTRAN program that computes the natural frequencies and eigenmode displacements of a three-degree of freedom spring-mass system.

## NAME
Eigenmode Finder - finds the natural frequencies and eigenmodes of a 3 degree of freedom spring-mass system with no applied force

## DESCRIPTION
Eigenmode Finder is a FORTRAN program that computes the natural frequencies and eigenmode displacements of a three-degree of freedom spring-mass system. It requires six inputs, 3 masses and 3 spring constants. The natural frequencies of the system are needed to find the eigenmode displacements of the system. The eigenmode displacements tell how much one of the nodes will move in comparison to the other two for the given frequency. 
Once the program is initialized, it has a self-explanatory user interface. The user inputs 3 mass values and 3 spring constant values.
